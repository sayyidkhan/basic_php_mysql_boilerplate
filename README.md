Blog Article: [Very simple add, edit, delete, view in PHP & MySQL](http://blog.chapagain.com.np/very-simple-add-edit-delete-view-in-php-mysql/)

SQL script to create database and tables is present in **database.sql** file.


## Batteries Included [App will work immediately right after u clone it]:
### no config required unless u have made changes to the application

- the application will dynamically create databases & tables when it does not exist
- if new tables are added, u will need to update the database.sql file + config.sql file

I did not build this from scratch, i customised it so that it could meet the needs of 2021 / 2022 PHP starter pack.
